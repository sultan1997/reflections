1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) when i want to show my work to public on gitHub then i will use remote 
repository

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather then having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A) so that we can complete our changes and then commit . If git automatically
does then there would be too many commits.
