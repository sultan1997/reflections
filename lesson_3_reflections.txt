1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) when i want to show my work to public on gitHub then i will use remote 
repository

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather then having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A) so that we can complete our changes and then commit . If git automatically
does then there would be too many commits.

3) Describe the difference between forks, clones , and branches . When would you use one instead of another?
A) fork is used for copying repository of other users on your GitHub account.
clones are used to download repository on internet directly on your computer.
branches are used to separate different changes and test it on your computer.

4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?
A) if there is a bug or a mistake in the file then we can go to previous state 
to restore it.

5) How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A) without using Git or GitHub i would sit together with my collaborater if he
is nearby , this will make the project completion much faster . however it will 
be harder to collaborate if we are separated by distance.

6)When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A) when i am collaborating with other people and want to check my changes then i will make it in separate branch since it wont disturb my main branch . however if i am working alone on project then i will make changes directly on my main 
branch with commits.
