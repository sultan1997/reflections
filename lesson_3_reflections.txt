1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) when i want to show my work to public on gitHub then i will use remote 
repository

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather then having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A) so that we can complete our changes and then commit . If git automatically
does then there would be too many commits.

3) Describe the difference between forks, clones , and branches . When would you use one instead of another?
A) fork is used for copying repository of other users on your GitHub account.
clones are used to download repository on internet directly on your computer.
branches are used to separate different changes and test it on your computer.
